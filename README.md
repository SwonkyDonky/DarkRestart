<h1>Dark Restart</h1>
A short text based adventure for the brave...



<h3>Code conventions for working on this</h3>
If you want to add more to this text based adventure, make sure to follow these conventions:
- Use camelCase, and english variable names
- Write comments above methods and important parts in code, so there wont be too many comments all over the place
- Clear and well written comments for git commits
- Use PascalCase for class names in the solution
- If you want to add more files and classes to the solution, think about managing them properly and using folders
- Use spaces in between code and tabs to make sure all code looks proper and is nice to read
